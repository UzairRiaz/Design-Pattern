# STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

## Adapter Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Adapter Pattern](./adapter.ts)
        Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It is useful when you need to use an existing class that does not have the interface you need, or when you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, or when you want to use an existing class in a new context without having to modify its source code.

## Decorator Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Decorator Pattern](./decorator.ts)
        Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. It is useful when you need to add functionality to an object without affecting other objects of the same class, or when you need to add functionality to an object that you may want to change or extend in the future.

## Facade Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Facade Pattern](./facade.ts)
        Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes. It is useful when you need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem, or when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

## Bridge Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Bridge Pattern](./bridge.ts)
        Bridge Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other. It is useful when you need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, or when you need to split a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, if the class can work with various database servers).

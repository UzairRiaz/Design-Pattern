# STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

## Adapter Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Adapter Pattern](./adapter.ts)
        Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It is useful when you need to use an existing class that does not have the interface you need, or when you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, or when you want to use an existing class in a new context without having to modify its source code.

## Decorator Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Decorator Pattern](./decorator.ts)
        Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. It is useful when you need to add functionality to an object without affecting other objects of the same class, or when you need to add functionality to an object that you may want to change or extend in the future.

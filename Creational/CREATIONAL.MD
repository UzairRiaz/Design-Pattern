# CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS

## Factory Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Factory Design Pattern](./factory.ts)
        Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It has a static method for creating objects, which can be useful when only one type of object is required at any one time. It is also useful when the type of object to create is determined by some input.

## Abstract Factory Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Abstract Factory Pattern](./abstract.ts)
        Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is used to create a set of related objects, or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is also called a factory of factories.

## Builder Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Builder Pattern](./builder.ts)
        Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. It is useful when you need to create an object that is made up of other objects, like a complex configuration of objects.

## Prototype Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Prototype Pattern](./prototype.ts)
        Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. It allows you to create copies of objects without having to depend on their specific classes. It is useful when you need to create a large number of similar objects, especially when they are complex.

## Singleton Design Pattern

-   [ ] [Singleton Pattern](./singleton.ts)
        Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance. It is useful when you need to have a single instance of a class that provides a global access point to that instance.

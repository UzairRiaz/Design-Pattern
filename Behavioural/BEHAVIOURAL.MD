## BEHAVIOURAL DESIGN PATTERNS

### Command Pattern

-   [Command Pattern](./command.ts)
    Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral pattern category. A request is wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker object. Invoker object looks for the appropriate object which can handle this command and passes the command to the corresponding object which executes the command.

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern

-   [Chain of Resposibility](./chain.ts)
    Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.
